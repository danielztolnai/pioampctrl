Crude software to control Pioneer AVRs over Ethernet. Based on documents found on the official [Pioneer website](https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Support/Home-Entertainment-Custom-Install/IR+Codes/A+V+Receivers).

This software is compatible with both Python 2.7+ and 3.4+. Tested with a Pioneer VSX-922.
